# hello-world

Hello everyone!

I'm Simeon, a hobbyist programmer currently pursuing an online computer science degree. I know a bit of Java and Python and am also somewhat familiar with web development. I'd like to give GitHub a try and see how I can improve my programming skills while contributing to different projects!
